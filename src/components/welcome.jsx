    <p>This is a variation of traditional modern chess.  Modern chess itself is the result of centuries of evolution and change.  The rules for pre-modern chess were not uniform throughout the world.</p>
    <p>One of these variants came from medieval Perisa.  Called Tamerlane chess, this game would be considered very complex by today's chess standards.  A version of that old Tamerlane chess that attempts to revise the ancient rules for more modern play is called Tamerlane Chess 2000, which is this web application.</p>
