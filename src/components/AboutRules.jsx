Another way to think of the elephant is it\'s a knight that can hop over to 1 diagonal or 2 diagonals, instead of a L-shape.", symbol: "üêò"},

The ship can\'t capture on the 1-square diagonal movement.  The ship can\'t jump over pieces like a knight.  This has almost the same power as a rook.", symbol: "‚öì"},

It has the same 1-square diagonal capture restriction as the ship.  Like the ship, the gryphon can\'t jump over pieces like a knight.  This piece has almost the same power as a queen.

The checkmated player then swaps the positions of the king and prince on their entire turn.  The player who caused checkmate may then decide to capture or not capture the prince.  Since each player has two princes, players are essentially given 2 free escapes in the game, extending the game time."},

If an opponent does this to you such that you already had a pawn 1 square horizontally of their landing spot, you can automatically capture the opponents pawn as if it moved only 1-square forward."},

Since there are no more princes, King\'s Succession is void."},
